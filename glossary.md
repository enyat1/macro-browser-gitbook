### Renderer Process
In browser architecture, the process responsible for rendering web content (parsing HTML, CSS, and executing JavaScript).

### Tracker
Software that collects data about users' online activities, often for advertising purposes.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A service that protects your internet connection by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address.

## Crypto & Web3 Terms

### Gas
The fee required to execute operations on the Ethereum network, paid in Ether.

### Layer 1
The main blockchain architecture, like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

### Layer 2
