## Security Architecture

Macro Browser's security architecture follows a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of protection.

### Security Layers

## Key Security Features

### Process Isolation and Sandboxing

Macro Browser uses a multi-process architecture with strict sandboxing:

- **Process Types**: Separate processes for browser UI, renderers, GPU, network, and utility functions
- **Privilege Separation**: Each process has minimal required privileges
- **Renderer Isolation**: Web content runs in isolated renderer processes
- **Site Isolation**: Different sites run in different processes to prevent cross-site data leaks
- **Sandbox Policies**: Strict OS-level sandboxing restricts process capabilities

### Network Security

Multiple layers of network security protect user data:

- **TLS Validation**: Strict validation of TLS certificates and connections
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatic upgrading to HTTPS when available
- **Certificate Transparency**: Verification against CT logs
- **HSTS Support**: Respect for HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **P2P VPN Encryption**: Additional encryption layer when VPN is enabled
- **DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS**: Encrypted DNS resolution to prevent snooping

### Content Security

Content security features protect against malicious web content:

- **Content Security Policy**: Enhanced CSP implementation
- **XSS Protection**: Built-in cross-site scripting protection
- **Phishing Detection**: Recognition of known phishing attempts
- **Resource Integrity**: Verification of subresource integrity
- **Frame Sandboxing**: Strict sandboxing of iframes
- **Permission Model**: Granular permission controls for web features

### Web3 Security

Special security measures for blockchain interactions:

- **Transaction Analysis**: Pre-execution analysis of transaction effects
- **Contract Verification**: Verification of smart contract source code
- **Address Validation**: Checks against known scam addresses
- **Permission Controls**: Domain-specific permission for dApps
- **Gas Monitoring**: Prevention of excessive gas fees
- **Signature Request Analysis**: Clear explanation of signature requests

## Data Privacy

Macro Browser's privacy architecture ensures user data is protected:

- **No Persistent History**: By default, no browsing history is saved
- **Memory-Only Storage**: Temporary data held in memory, not on disk
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential data is collected or processed
- **Limited Data Sharing**: Minimal data shared with external services
- **Anonymized Queries**: Search queries are anonymized before processing
- **Session Isolation**: Each browsing session is isolated

## Authentication and Authorization

For features requiring authentication:

- **Wallet Authentication**: Secure wallet connection process
- **Permission Model**: Explicit user consent for sensitive operations
- **Transaction Signing**: Clear approval process for blockchain transactions
- **API Authorization**: Secure handling of API keys and tokens
- **Local Authentication**: Option for local authentication for sensitive settings

## Threat Mitigation

Strategies to mitigate common threats:

| Threat | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|---------------------|
| Man-in-the-Middle | TLS validation, certificate pinning, VPN encryption |
| Phishing | Visual security indicators, domain verification, warnings |
| Malware | Content filtering, script blocking, sandboxing |
| Cross-Site Scripting | CSP enforcement, input sanitization, output encoding |
| Tracking | Tracker blocking, fingerprinting protection, private browsing mode |
| Web3 Scams | Contract verification, phishing protection, transaction analysis |
| DNS Attacks | DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS caching, DNSSEC validation |
| Browser Exploits | Regular updates, process isolation, reduced attack surface |

## Security Response Process

In case of security vulnerabilities:

1. **Discovery**: Identification of potential security issue
2. **Assessment**: Evaluation of impact and risk
3. **Resolution**: Development of fix or mitigation
4. **Deployment**: Rapid update distribution to users
5. **Disclosure**: Responsible disclosure after patching

## Regular Security Audits

Macro Browser undergoes regular security reviews:

- **Code Audits**: Regular review of source code for vulnerabilities
- **Penetration Testing**: Active testing for security weaknesses
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitoring of third-party dependencies
- **Cryptographic Review**: Analysis of cryptographic implementations
- **Privacy Assessment**: Review of data handling practices
