# Technical Architecture

This section provides a detailed overview of Macro Browser's technical architecture, design principles, and implementation specifics.

## Architecture Overview

Macro Browser follows a modular, component-based architecture that prioritizes security, privacy, and Web3 integration. This architecture enables clean separation of concerns while maintaining high performance and extensibility.

## Technology Stack

Macro Browser is built using the following core technologies:

- **Electron**: Cross-platform framework that enables using web technologies to build desktop applications
- **Chromium**: Open-source browser project that powers Macro Browser's rendering engine
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Primary programming languages for application logic
- **React**: UI library for building the browser's interface components
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the intelligent search capabilities
- **MetaMask SDK**: Enables wallet connectivity and Web3 functionality
- **WireGuard/NetBird**: Underlying technology for the P2P VPN feature

## Core Architectural Principles

1. **Security by Design**: Security considerations are built into every component from the ground up
2. **Privacy First**: All features prioritize user privacy and data minimization
3. **Modular Components**: Clean separation of concerns allows for independent evolution of features
4. **Zero Trust**: No component inherently trusts another without verification
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality remains available even if enhanced features are disabled

## System Process Architecture

The browser operates as a desktop application with several processes:

- **Main Process**: Manages application lifecycle and creates renderer processes
- **Renderer Processes**: Handle the display of web content in browser windows
- **GPU Process**: Handles GPU acceleration for rendering
- **Network Service**: Manages network requests and the VPN connection
- **Utility Processes**: Handle various tasks like extension execution
