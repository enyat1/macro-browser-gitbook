applications and websites with Macro Browser. It covers Web3 integration, optimizing for privacy features, and working with the browser's unique capabilities.\nOverview\nMacro Browser provides several integration points for developers:\n\nWeb3 Integration\nDetecting Macro Browser\nYou can detect if a user is browsing with Macro Browser through the user agent or by checking for the Macro Browser provider:\n// Check for Macro provider\nfunction isMacroBrowser() {\n  return typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined' && \n         window.ethereum.isMacro === true;\n}\n\n// Optimal approach - feature detection\nasync function detectMacroBrowser() {\n  if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n    try {\n      const provider = window.ethereum;\n      const providerInfo = await provider.request({ method: 'web3_clientVersion' });\n      return providerInfo.toLowerCase().includes('macro');\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error detecting browser:', error);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n\nConnecting to the Wallet\nMacro Browser follows the EIP-1193 standard for wallet connections:\n// Example of connecting to the user's wallet\nasync function connectWallet() {\n  if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n    try {\n      // Request account access\n      const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ \n        method: 'eth_requestAccounts' \n      });\n\n      // Get the connected account\n      const account = accounts[0];\n      console.log('Connected account:', account);\n\n      return account;\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error.code === 4001) {\n        // User rejected the connection request\n        console.log('User rejected connection request');\n      } else {\n        console.error('Error connecting to wallet:', error);\n      }\n      return null;\n    }\n  } else {\n    console.log('Ethereum provider not found');\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nHandling Chain Switching\nUsers may need to switch between different blockchain networks:\n// Example of requesting a chain switch\nasync function switchToChain(chainId) {\n  try {\n    await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',\n      params: [{ chainId }],\n    });\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    // This error code indicates the chain has not been added to the wallet\n    if (error.code === 4902) {\n      try {\n        await addChain(chainId);\n        return true;\n      } catch (addError) {\n        console.error('Error adding chain:', addError);\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    console.error('Error switching chain:', error);\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example of adding a new chain\nasync function addChain(chainId) {\n  const chainParams = getChainParams(chainId);\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',\n    params: [chainParams],\n  });\n}\n\n// Helper to get chain parameters\nfunction getChainParams(chainId) {\n  // Example for Polygon\n  if (chainId === '0x89') {\n    return {\n      chainId: '0x89',\n      chainName: 'Polygon Mainnet',\n      nativeCurrency: {\n        name: 'MATIC',\n        symbol: 'MATIC',\n        decimals: 18\n      },\n      rpcUrls: ['https://polygon-rpc.com/'],\n      blockExplorerUrls: ['https://polygonscan.com/']\n    };\n  }\n\n  // Add other chains as needed\n  // ...\n}\n\nSending Transactions\nTransactions in Macro Browser follow standard Web3 patterns with enhanced security:\n// Example of sending a transaction\nasync function sendTransaction(to, value, data = '0x') {\n  try {\n    const transactionParameters = {\n      to,\n      from: window.ethereum.selectedAddress,\n      value: value.toString(16), // Convert to hex\n      data\n    };\n\n    // Optional: Let the wallet estimate gas\n    // Or you can estimate and include it:\n    // transactionParameters.gas = await estimateGas(transactionParameters);\n\n    const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'eth_sendTransaction',\n      params: [transactionParameters],\n    });\n\n    console.log('Transaction sent:', txHash);\n    return txHash;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error sending transaction:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\nBest Practices for dApps\nWhen building dApps for Macro Browser:\n\nAlways use feature detection rather than user agent sniffing\nHandle wallet connection rejection gracefully\nProvide clear transaction information to help users make informed decisions\nImplement proper error handling for all Web3 interactions\nSupport multiple chains where appropriate\nConsider privacy implications of your dApp's design\nTest with Macro Browser during development\n\nPrivacy Features Integration\nContent Security Policy\nMacro Browser enforces strict Content Security Policy (CSP) rules. Ensure your site works with strong CSP headers:\n\n\n\nTracker-Free Design\nDesign your site to work without trackers and third-party cookies:\n\nAvoid third-party resources when possible\nSelf-host critical scripts rather than using CDNs\nDon't rely on fingerprinting for identification\nUse local storage sparingly (it's cleared between sessions)\nImplement privacy-respecting analytics if needed\n\nPerformance with Ad Blocking\nOptimize your site to work well with ad blockers:\n\nDon't use class names that trigger ad blockers (e.g., \"ad\", \"banner\", \"sponsor\")\nAvoid DOM structures similar to ads\nDon't load content from known ad domains\nTest your site with ad blockers enabled\n\nUI Integration\nDark Mode Support\nMacro Browser uses dark mode by default. Ensure your site supports dark mode:\n/* Example of dark mode support */\n:root {\n  --text-color: #333;\n  --background-color: #fff;\n  --link-color: #0066cc;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root {\n    --text-color: #eee;\n    --background-color: #222;\n    --link-color: #6699ff;\n  }\n}\n\nbody {\n  color: var(--text-color);\n  background-color: var(--background-color);\n}\n\na {\n  color: var(--link-color);\n}\n\nResponsive Design\nEnsure your site is fully responsive and works well at different viewport sizes:\n\nUse responsive layouts with flexbox or grid\nTest on various screen sizes\nImplement proper touch support for mobile users\nOptimize loading performance for all devices\n\nAI Search Optimization\nOptimize your content for Macro Browser's AI-powered search:\n\nUse clear, descriptive page titles\nImplement proper semantic HTML (headings, lists, etc.)\nInclude concise meta descriptions\nStructure content logically with clear sections\nUse schema.org markup for enhanced understanding\n\n\n\n  Product Name\n  \n  Product description goes here...\n  \n    $19.99\n    \n  \n\n\nTesting with Macro Browser\nDevelopment Environment Setup\nTo test your site or dApp with Macro Browser during development:\n\nInstall Macro Browser for your platform\nConfigure developer mode in settings\nUse the developer tools (similar to Chrome DevTools)\nTest with all privacy features enabled\n\nCommon Integration Issues\nWatch out for these common integration problems:\n\nReliance on persistent storage across sessions\nAssuming availability of third-party scripts that might be blocked\nNot handling wallet connection rejections properly\nUI issues in dark mode\nPerformance problems due to blocked resources\n\nCompatibility Checklist\n✅ Site works with strict Content Security Policy✅ All critical functionality works without third-party cookies✅ Dark mode design is implemented and tested✅ Web3 connections handle all error cases gracefully✅ No dependencies on known tracking domains✅ Semantic HTML is used throughout the site✅ Site performs well with ad/tracker blocking enabled  \nAdvanced Integration\nExtension Development\nMacro Browser supports a limited set of extensions focused on privacy and security:\n\nFocus on privacy-enhancing features\nAvoid requiring broad permissions\nFollow Manifest V3 guidelines\nSubmit to the Macro Browser extension review process\n\nCustom Protocol Handlers\nRegister custom protocol handlers for your application:\n// Example of registering a protocol handler\nif ('registerProtocolHandler' in navigator) {\n  navigator.registerProtocolHandler(\n    'web+yourprotocol',\n    'https://yourapp.com/handle?url=%s',\n    'Your App Name'\n  );\n}\n\nSupport and Resources\n\nDeveloper Discord: Join our community at discord.gg/macrobrowser\nGitHub Repository: github.com/macro-browser/macro-browser\nDocumentation: docs.macrobrowser.com\nIssue Tracker: github.com/macro-browser/macro-browser/issues\n\n"},"developers/web3-api.html":{"url":"developers/web3-api.html","title":"Web3 API Reference","keywords":"","body":"Web3 API Reference\nThis document provides detailed reference information for developers integrating with Macro Browser's Web3 capabilities.\nProvider Object\nMacro Browser injects a standard Web3 provider object (window.ethereum) into all pages, following the EIP-1193 specification with some Macro-specific enhancements.\ninterface MacroProvider {\n  // Standard EIP-1193 Properties\n  isConnected(): boolean;\n  chainId: string;\n  selectedAddress: string | null;\n\n  // Standard EIP-1193 Methods\n  request(args: RequestArguments): Promise;\n  on(eventName: string, listener: (arg: any) => void): Provider;\n  removeListener(eventName: string, listener: (arg: any) => void): Provider;\n\n  // Macro Browser Specific\n  isMacro: boolean;

// List of block explorers\n  iconUrls?: string[];          // List of chain icons\n}\n\nSecurity Considerations\nTransaction Analysis\nMacro Browser performs advanced transaction analysis for user safety:\n// Example of using the transaction analysis feature\nasync function analyzeBeforeSending(transactionObject) {\n  try {\n    // Get security analysis\n    const analysis = await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'macro_analyzeTransaction',\n      params: [transactionObject]\n    });\n\n    // Check risk level\n    if (analysis.riskLevel === 'high') {\n      // Show warning to user\n      const proceed = confirm(\n        `Warning: This transaction has high risk factors:\\n` +\n        analysis.warnings.join('\\n') + '\\n\\n' +\n        'Do you want to proceed anyway?'\n      );\n\n      if (!proceed) {\n        throw new Error('Transaction cancelled due to security concerns');\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Proceed with transaction\n    return await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'eth_sendTransaction',\n      params: [transactionObject]\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Transaction error:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\nPermissions\nAlways check for permissions before attempting operations:\nasync function checkPermissions() {\n  try {\n    const permissions = await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'wallet_getPermissions'\n    });\n\n    // Check if we have eth_accounts permission\n    const hasAccountsPermission = permissions.some(\n      permission => permission.parentCapability === 'eth_accounts'\n    );\n\n    if (!hasAccountsPermission) {\n      console.log('No account permissions. Request access first.');\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error checking permissions:', error);\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\nError Handling\nMacro Browser provides detailed error codes. Handle common errors properly:\nasync function handleWeb3Operation(operation) {\n  try {\n    return await operation();\n  } catch (error) {\n    switch (error.code) {\n      case 4001:\n        console.log('User rejected the request');\n        break;\n      case 4100:\n        console.log('Unauthorized - request not approved');\n        break;\n      case 4200:\n        console.log('Unsupported method');\n        break;\n      case 4900:\n        console.log('Disconnected from chain');\n        break;\n      case 4901:\n        console.log('Chain not available');\n        break;\n      case 4902:\n        console.log('Chain not added - suggest adding it');\n        break;\n      default:\n        console.error('Unknown error:', error);\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\nUsage Examples\nConnecting to a dApp\nasync function connectDApp() {\n  if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n    try {\n      // Request account access\n      const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({\n        method: 'eth_requestAccounts'\n      });\n\n      // Get chain ID\n      const chainId = await window.ethereum.request({\n        method: 'eth_chainId'\n      });\n\n      // Initialize your dApp with connected account and chain\n      initializeDApp(accounts[0], chainId);\n\n      // Set up event listeners\n      window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', handleAccountsChanged);\n      window.ethereum.on('chainChanged', handleChainChanged);\n\n      return true;\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error connecting to dApp:', error);\n      return false;\n    }\n  } else {\n    console.error('No Ethereum provider found');\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\nContract Interaction\nasync function callContractMethod(contractAddress, methodABI, params) {\n  // Encode function call\n  const methodSignature = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature(methodABI);\n  const encodedParams = web3.eth.abi.encodeParameters(\n    methodABI.inputs.map(input => input.type),\n    params\n  );\n\n  const data = methodSignature + encodedParams.slice(2);\n\n  // Call the contract\n  const result = await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'eth_call',\n    params: [{\n      to: contractAddress,\n      data: data\n    }, 'latest']\n  });\n\n  // Decode result\n  return web3.eth.abi.decodeParameter(\n    methodABI.outputs[0].type,\n    result\n  );\n}\n\nTransaction with Confirmation\nasync function sendTransactionWithConfirmation(tx) {\n  try {\n    // Send transaction\n    const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'eth_sendTransaction',\n      params: [tx]\n    });\n\n    console.log('Transaction sent:', txHash);\n\n    // Poll for receipt\n    let receipt = null;\n    while (receipt === null) {\n      try {\n        receipt = await window.ethereum.request({\n          method: 'eth_getTransactionReceipt',\n          params: [txHash]\n        });\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.error('Error polling for receipt:', e);\n      }\n\n      if (receipt === null) {\n        // Wait 2 seconds before polling again\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n      }\n    }\n\n    console.log('Transaction confirmed:', receipt);\n    return receipt;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\nCompatibility Notes\nBrowser Differences\nMacro Browser implements the same provider API as MetaMask with some differences:\n\nAll accounts are treated as \"read-only\" by default for security\nContains extra security checks for potentially risky operations\nProvides additional methods for transaction analysis\nNo support for legacy methods that have security implications\n\nFeature Detection\nAlways use feature detection instead of browser detection:\n// Check for specific method support\nasync function hasAnalysisSupport() {\n  if (typeof window.ethereum === 'undefined') return false;\n\n  try {\n    // Try getting provider metadata\n    const metadata = await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'web3_clientVersion'\n    });\n\n    // Check for explicit macro support\n    if (window.ethereum.isMacro === true) return true;\n\n    // Check if client version mentions macro\n    if (typeof metadata === 'string' && \n        metadata.toLowerCase().includes('macro')) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    // Try calling macro-specific method\n    try {\n      await window.ethereum.request({\n        method: 'macro_getVersion'\n      });\n      return true;\n    } catch (e) {\n      // Method doesn't exist\n      return false;\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\n"},"developers/privacy-api.html":{"url":"developers/privacy-api.html","title":"Privacy API

|\n  'clipboard-write' | 'payment-handler' | 'idle-detection';\n\ninterface PermissionOptions {\n  duration?: 'once' | 'session' | 'persistent'; // Default: session\n  explicitUserActivation?: boolean; // Require user gesture\n}\n\ninterface PermissionStatus {\n  permission: PrivacyPermissionType;\n  state: 'granted' | 'denied' | 'prompt';\n  expiresAt?: Date; // For temporary permissions\n}\n\nUsage Example\n// Request necessary permissions\nasync function setupApp() {\n  if (window.macroPrivacyPermissions) {\n    // Check if we already have permissions\n    const

// Storage permission was revoked\n    switchToMemoryStorage();\n  }\n}\n\nPrivacy-Aware Analytics API\nThe Privacy-Aware Analytics API provides a way to collect anonymous analytics while respecting user privacy.\ninterface MacroPrivacyAnalytics {\n  // Send anonymous event\n  sendAnonymousEvent(\n    eventName: string,\n    properties?: Record\n  ): Promise;\n\n  // Get allowed analytics properties\n  getAllowedProperties(): string[];\n\n  // Get current anonymization level\n  getAnonymizationLevel(): AnonymizationLevel;\n}\n\ntype AnonymizationLevel = 'strict' | 'balanced' | 'minimal';\n\nUsage Example\n// Use privacy-aware analytics\nasync function trackPageView() {\n  if (window.macroPrivacyAnalytics) {\n    // Privacy-respecting analytics in Macro Browser\n\n    // Check what properties are allowed\n    const allowedProps = await window.macroPrivacyAnalytics.getAllowedProperties();\n    console.log('Allowed properties:', allowedProps);\n\n    // Get current anonymization level\n    const anonymizationLevel = await window.macroPrivacyAnalytics.getAnonymizationLevel();\n\n    // Prepare properties based on allowed list\n    const properties = {\n      pagePath: window.location.pathname,\n      referrer: document.referrer,\n      screenSize: `${window.innerWidth}x${window.innerHeight}`,\n      // No user identifiers or precise information\n    };\n\n    // Filter to only allowed properties\n    const filteredProps = {};\n    for (const prop of allowedProps) {\n      if (properties[prop] !== undefined) {\n        filteredProps[prop] =

else {\n    // Regular analytics for other browsers\n    trackPageViewRegular();\n  }\n}\n\nBest Practices\nFeature Detection\nAlways use feature detection instead of browser detection:\n// Good: Feature detection\nif (window.macroPrivacy) {\n  // Use Macro Browser privacy features\n} else {\n  // Use fallback approach\n}\n\n// Bad: Browser detection\nif (navigator.userAgent.includes('MacroBrowser')) {\n  // Unreliable and brittle\n}\n\nProgressive Enhancement\nDesign for progressive enhancement to work across all browsers:\n// Start with core functionality that works everywhere\ninitializeBasicFunctionality();\n\n// Enhance with Macro-specific features when available\nif (window.macroPrivacy) {\n  enhanceWithPrivacyFeatures();\n}\n\nif (window.macroEphemeralStorage) {\n  enhanceWithEphemeralStorage();\n}\n\nif (window.macroFingerprintProtection) {\n  enhanceWithFingerprintProtection();\n}\n\nProvide Alternatives\nAlways provide privacy-respecting alternatives:\nfunction setupAnalytics() {\n  if (window.macroPrivacyAnalytics) {\n    // Use privacy-aware analytics\n    initializeMacroAnalytics();\n  } else if (isPrivacyFocusedBrowser()) {\n    // For other privacy browsers\n    initializeMinimalAnalytics();\n  } else {\n    // Standard analytics with opt-out\n    initializeStandardAnalyticsWithOptOut();\n  }\n}\n\nRespect User Choices\nAlways respect user choices regarding privacy:\nasync function checkTrackingConsent() {\n  if (window.macroPrivacy) {\n    // Respect Macro Browser settings automatically\n    return !window.macroPrivacy.isTrackingProtectionEnabled;\n  } else {\n    // For other browsers, explicitly ask\n    return await getUserConsentForTracking();\n  }\n}\n\nAPI

Handle errors gracefully\n    console.error('Privacy API error:', error);\n    // Continue with alternative functionality\n    provideFallbackExperience();\n  }\n}\n\nConclusion\nThe privacy APIs in Macro Browser enable developers to create privacy-respecting applications while maintaining compatibility with the broader web. By using these APIs properly and following the best practices, you can provide enhanced functionality specifically for Macro Browser users while ensuring a good experience for all users. \n"},"developers/performance-guide.html":{"url":"developers/performance-guide.html","title":"Performance Optimization Guide","keywords":"","body":"Performance Optimization Guide\nThis guide provides recommendations for optimizing your website or application performance when running in Macro Browser.\nUnderstanding Macro Browser's Architecture\nMacro Browser has several key architectural features that affect performance:\n\nMulti-Process Architecture: Like other Chromium-based browsers, Macro Browser uses separate processes for the browser core, renderer, GPU, and networking.\nPrivacy Features: Privacy protection mechanisms may impact performance in specific scenarios.\nP2P VPN Integration: Network requests may be routed through the P2P VPN network.\nMemory-First Storage: Macro Browser minimizes disk operations for privacy.\n\nPerformance Best Practices\nResource Loading Optimization\n\nPrioritize Critical Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  /* Critical CSS here */\n  .header { /* ... */ }\n  .hero { /* ... */ }\n\n\nLazy Loading\n\n\n\n\n\n  if ('loading' in HTMLImageElement.prototype) {\n    // Convert to use native lazy loading\n    document.querySelectorAll('img.lazy-image').forEach(img => {\n      img.src = img.dataset.src;\n    });\n  } else {\n    // Use intersection observer polyfill\n    // ...\n  }\n\n\nEfficient JavaScript Loading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering Performance\nDOM Size Optimization\nMacro Browser, like all Chromium-based browsers, performs better with smaller DOM trees:\n\nKeep DOM nodes under 1,500 if possible\nMaximum depth of 32 elements\nNo parent node with more than 60 child nodes\n\nCSS Optimization\n/* Avoid expensive CSS properties */\n.good {\n  transform: translateZ(0);  /* Uses GPU acceleration */\n}\n\n.avoid-when-possible {\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); /* Can be expensive */\n  filter: blur(5px);         /* Expensive for large elements */\n  position: fixed;           /* Can trigger full repaints */\n}\n\n/* Use efficient selectors */\n.efficient { color: blue; }              /* Good - class selector */\n.parent > .child { color: blue; }        /* OK - one level of inheritance */\n.parent .child .grandchild { color: blue; } /* Avoid - expensive */\n\nAnimation Performance\nFor smooth animations, especially in privacy-focused browsers:\n// Use requestAnimationFrame for animations\nfunction animate() {\n  // Update animation\n  element.style.transform = `translateX(${position}px)`;\n\n  // Schedule next frame\n  requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n}\n\n// Start animation\nrequestAnimationFrame(animate);\n\n// Prefer CSS animations for simple cases\nconst styles = `\n.animated {\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out;\n  will-change: transform;\n}\n`;\n\nCompositor-Only Properties\nFor the best animation performance, prefer properties that only affect the compositor:\n\nGood properties: transform, opacity\nAvoid animating: width, height, left, top, background-color\n\nMemory Management\nEfficient Data Structures\n// Use appropriate data structures\n// Map for key-value pairs with non-string keys\nconst userCache = new Map();\n\n// Set for unique values\nconst uniqueVisitors = new Set();\n\n// TypedArrays for binary data\nconst binaryData = new Uint8Array(1024);\n\nMemory Leaks Prevention\nParticularly important in Macro Browser as it runs a memory-first approach:\nclass Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this.element = document.createElement('div');\n    this.bindEvents();\n  }\n\n  bindEvents() {\n    // Store reference to bound function for later removal\n    this.boundClickHandler = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n    this.element.addEventListener('click', this.boundClickHandler);\n  }\n\n  handleClick() {\n    // Handle click\n  }\n\n  destroy() {\n    // Remove event listeners\n    this.element.removeEventListener('click', this.boundClickHandler);\n    // Remove references\n    this.element = null;\n    this.boundClickHandler = null;\n  }\n}\n\nNetwork Optimization\nBandwidth Efficiency\nMacro Browser routes traffic through privacy layers, making bandwidth optimization particularly important:\n// Compress API responses\nconst compressionMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {\n  // Only compress certain content types\n  if (shouldCompress(req)) {\n    res.setHeader('Content-Encoding', 'gzip');\n    // Compress response\n  }\n  next();\n};\n\n// Client-side request batching\nasync function batchRequests(requests) {\n  // Combine multiple related API calls\n  return fetch('/batch', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ requests })\n  }).then(res => res.json());\n}\n\nCache-Aware Programming\n// Use cache headers properly\napp.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {\n  // Add cache headers\n  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=300');\n  res.setHeader('ETag', generateETag(data));\n  res.json(data);\n});\n\n// Client-side caching with Service Worker\nconst CACHE_NAME = 'app-v1';\n\nself.addEventListener('install', (event) => {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {\n      return cache.addAll([\n        '/',\n        '/index.html',\n        '/styles.css',\n        '/app.js',\n      ]);\n    })\n  );\n});\n\nWeb3 Specific Optimizations\nEfficient Contract Calls\n// Batch reads using multicall\nasync function batchContractCalls(contract, methodName, paramSets) {\n  const multicallContract = new ethers.Contract(\n    MULTICALL_ADDRESS, \n    MULTICALL_ABI, \n    provider\n  );\n\n  const calls = paramSets.map(params => ({\n    target: contract.address,\n    callData: contract.interface.encodeFunctionData(methodName, params)\n  }));\n\n  const { returnData } = await multicallContract.aggregate(calls);\n\n  return returnData.map(data => \n    contract.interface.decodeFunctionResult(methodName, data)\n  );\n}\n\nState Management for Web3\n// Cache transaction data\nclass TransactionCache {\n  constructor(ttlSeconds = 60) {\n    this.cache = new Map();\n    this.ttl = ttlSeconds * 1000;\n  }\n\n  set(txHash, data) {\n    const expiry = Date.now() + this.ttl;\n    this.cache.set(txHash, { data, expiry });\n  }\n\n  get(txHash) {\n    const cached = this.cache.get(txHash);\n    if (!cached) return null;\n\n    if (cached.expiry \nMacro-Specific Optimizations\nPrivacy-Aware Analytics\nStandard analytics often get blocked. Consider privacy-friendly alternatives:\n// Simple privacy-respecting analytics\nconst sendAnalytics = (event) => {\n  // Only collect non-identifying metrics\n  const data = {\n    eventName: event,\n    // No user identifiers\n    screen: {\n      width: window.innerWidth,\n      height: window.innerHeight\n    },\n    timestamp: Date.now()\n  };\n\n  // Use sendBeacon for reliability\n  navigator.sendBeacon('/analytics', JSON.stringify(data));\n};\n\nVPN-Aware Networking\nWhen the P2P VPN is active, network requests might have different characteristics:\n// Check if VPN is enabled (Macro-specific feature)\nasync function isVpnEnabled() {\n  if (window.ethereum && window.ethereum.isMacro) {\n    try {\n      return await window.ethereum.request({\n        method: 'macro_isVpnEnabled'\n      });\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error('Error checking VPN status:', e);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n\n// Adapt network strategy based on VPN status\nasync function optimizeNetworkRequests() {\n  const vpnEnabled = await isVpnEnabled();\n\n  if (vpnEnabled) {\n    // When VPN is enabled:\n    // 1.

It combines advanced privacy features like a built-in P2P VPN and ad blocking with native Web3 functionality for a seamless crypto experience.\nIs Macro Browser free to use?\nYes, Macro Browser is free to download and use. We may introduce premium features in the future, but the core browser functionality will remain free.\nWhich operating systems does Macro Browser support?\nMacro Browser supports Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, and major Linux distributions like Ubuntu 18.04+ and Fedora 30+.\nPrivacy & Security\nHow is Macro Browser different from private/incognito mode in other browsers?\nUnlike regular browsers where private mode is optional, Macro Browser operates in private mode by default. Additionally, it removes Google services from the underlying Chromium engine, includes a built-in P2P VPN, and provides stronger anti-tracking measures than standard private browsing modes.\nDoes Macro Browser collect any user data?\nNo, Macro Browser does not collect browsing history, usage statistics, or any personally identifiable information. The browser operates with a strict no-logging policy.\nHow does the P2P VPN work?\nMacro Browser's P2P VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a network of peers. Your internet traffic is routed through this peer-to-peer network, making it difficult to track your online activities. Unlike traditional VPNs, there's no central server storing connection logs.\nIs my browsing history saved anywhere?\nNo, Macro Browser does not save browsing history to your disk. All browsing data is kept in memory and cleared when you close the browser.\nWeb3 & Wallet Features\nDoes Macro Browser have a built-in crypto wallet?\nMacro Browser allows you to connect existing wallets like MetaMask or use our integrated wallet solution. We focus on providing a seamless interface rather than creating yet another wallet to manage.\nWhich blockchains does Macro Browser support?\nMacro Browser supports all major Ethereum-compatible blockchains and networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, and more.\nIs my private key safe in Macro Browser?\nMacro Browser never has access to your private keys. When using connected wallets like MetaMask, the keys remain secure in your wallet. Our integrated wallet solution uses secure local encryption for any key storage.\nHow does Macro Browser interact with dApps?\nMacro Browser provides native support for Web3 websites and dApps, allowing secure connections between the sites and your wallet. All connection requests and transactions require explicit user approval.\nTechnical Questions\nIs Macro Browser based on Chromium?\nYes, Macro Browser is built on Electron, which uses Chromium as its rendering engine. However, we've removed Google-specific services and tracking components from the Chromium base.\nCan I install extensions in Macro Browser?\nCurrently, Macro Browser does not support Chrome Web Store extensions. We've built the most essential functionality (ad blocking, tracker prevention) directly into the browser. Support for a curated set of privacy-focused extensions may be added in the future.\nHow does the AI-powered search work?\nMacro Browser's search bar uses the OpenAI API to provide intelligent search suggestions and answer queries directly when possible. Search queries are processed securely and privately without persistent logging.\nHow often is Macro Browser updated?\nWe release regular updates to improve functionality and security. The browser will automatically check for updates and notify you when they're available.\nSupport\nWhere can I report bugs or request features?\nYou can report bugs or request features through our GitHub repository at github.com/macro-browser/macro-browser or by contacting our support team at support@macrobrowser.com.\nHow can I get help if I'm having problems with Macro Browser?\nVisit our community forum for user discussions and support. For direct assistance, contact our support team at support@macrobrowser.com. \n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nBrowser & Privacy Terms\nAd Blocker\nSoftware that prevents advertisements from being displayed on web pages.\nChromium\nAn open-source browser project that provides the foundation for many browsers, including Google Chrome and Macro Browser.\ndApp (Decentralized Application)\nAn application that runs on a decentralized network (typically a blockchain) rather than on centralized servers.\nDe-Googled\nThe process of removing Google services, APIs, and tracking components from Chromium-based software.\nDNS (Domain Name System)\nThe system that translates human-readable domain names (like macrobrowser.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.\nElectron\nA framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).\nFingerprinting\nA technique used to identify and track users based on their browser configuration, system settings, and behavior.\nHTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)\nA secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between a browser and the website it's connected to, with encryption provided by SSL/TLS.\nIncognito Mode / Private Browsing\nA browsing mode that doesn't save browsing history, cookies, or form data after the session ends.\nRenderer Process\nIn browser architecture, the process responsible for rendering web content (parsing HTML, CSS, and executing JavaScript).\nTracker\nSoftware that collects data about users' online activities, often for advertising purposes.\nVPN (Virtual Private Network)\nA service that protects your internet connection by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address.\nCrypto & Web3 Terms\nABI (Application Binary Interface)\nThe standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interactions.\nBlockchain\nA distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions across many computers.\nDeFi (Decentralized Finance)\nFinancial services and products built on blockchain technology, operating without centralized intermediaries.\nEIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal)\nDocuments proposing new features or processes for Ethereum and its related components.\nERC (Ethereum Request for Comment)\nTechnical standards used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, such as ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nGas\nThe fee required to execute operations on the Ethereum network, paid in Ether.\nLayer 1\nThe main blockchain architecture, like Ethereum or Bitcoin.\nLayer 2\nScaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 blockchains to improve transaction speed and reduce costs.\nMetamask\nA popular browser extension and mobile app that serves as an Ethereum wallet and gateway to blockchain applications.\nNFT (Non-Fungible Token)\nA cryptographic token that represents ownership of a unique item or piece of content.\nP2P (Peer-to-Peer)\nA decentralized network where computers can communicate directly without requiring a central server.\nPrivate Key\nA secret number that allows cryptocurrency transactions to be signed and authorized.\nRPC (Remote Procedure Call)\nA protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer on a network.\nSmart Contract\nSelf-executing code that runs on a blockchain and automatically enforces the terms of an agreement.\nWeb3\nThe concept of a decentralized web, built on blockchain technology, where users have control over their data and digital assets.\nWallet\nSoftware or hardware that stores private keys and allows users to interact with blockchain networks.\nTechnical Implementation Terms\nAPI (Application Programming Interface)\nA set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.\nCPU Process\nA process that performs computational tasks using the computer's central processing unit.\nGPU Process\nA process that utilizes the graphics processing unit for rendering and computational tasks.\nIPC (Inter-Process Communication)\nThe mechanisms an operating system provides to allow processes to manage shared data.\nReact\nA JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.\nSandbox\nA security mechanism that provides a separated environment for running applications with limited access to system resources.\nTypeScript\nA programming language that adds static types to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.\nUI (User Interface)\nThe visual elements and interactive components through which users interact with software.\nWireGuard\nA modern VPN protocol focused on simplicity and performance. \n"}}}
