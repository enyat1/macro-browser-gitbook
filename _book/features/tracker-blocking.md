## How Trackers Work

Modern web trackers employ various techniques to monitor user behavior:

- **Cookies**: Small files stored on your device that identify you across websites
- **Fingerprinting**: Creating a unique identifier based on your device characteristics
- **Pixel Tags**: Invisible images that track when you load a page or email
- **Local Storage**: Browser storage mechanisms that persist even when cookies are cleared
- **Session Tracking**: Following your activity during a single browsing session
- **Cross-Site Tracking**: Linking your identity across different websites

## Macro's Tracker Blocking Technology

Macro Browser employs a multi-layered approach to tracker blocking:

### Machine Learning Detection

Our system uses advanced machine learning to identify tracking behavior:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies tracking code patterns, even when disguised
- **Behavior Analysis**: Monitors script behavior for tracking activities
- **Network Analysis**: Examines network requests for telltale tracking signatures
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Continually updates to recognize new tracking methods
- **False Positive Prevention**: Avoids blocking legitimate website functionality

### Comprehensive Blocking Methods

The tracker blocker implements multiple defensive strategies:

- **Request Filtering**: Blocks network requests to known tracking domains
- **Script Analysis**: Examines and blocks scripts with tracking capabilities
- **Cookie Partitioning**: Isolates cookies to prevent cross-site tracking
